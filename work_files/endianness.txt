The ARM Cortex-M0+ uses **little-endian** byte ordering, meaning the least significant byte is stored first in memory (at the lowest address). This is the standard for ARM Cortex-M processors, including most of the low-power cores like the M0+.

Here’s a bit more detail:

- **Little-endian** means the least significant byte (LSB) is stored at the lowest memory address, and the most significant byte (MSB) is stored at the highest.
- ARM cores (including the Cortex-M0+) can also support **big-endian** mode, but by default, they operate in little-endian. However, the ability to switch to big-endian mode can be enabled through configuration, though it’s rarely used in most embedded systems.

For the **Cortex-M0+** specifically, the architecture (ARMv6-M) is optimized for little-endian and doesn’t have the flexibility of the ARMv7 or ARMv8 series where big-endian could be more commonly configured.

Great! I read something about an endianness for bytes and another one for bits, can you explain it in detail, please?

Certainly! Let's break down the two types of endianness you're referring to: **byte endianness** and **bit endianness**. 

### 1. **Byte Endianness**
This is the most common type of endianness discussed in computer systems and memory storage. It deals with how **multiple bytes** of data are ordered in memory.

There are two primary types of byte endianness:

- **Little-endian**: The least significant byte (LSB) is stored first (at the lowest memory address). In this case, the "little end" of the data is placed at the beginning.
  
- **Big-endian**: The most significant byte (MSB) is stored first (at the lowest memory address). The "big end" of the data is placed at the beginning.

**Example with a 32-bit number (0x12345678):**

- **Little-endian**: The memory representation is:
  ```
  Address    | 0x00  | 0x01  | 0x02  | 0x03
  Value      | 0x78  | 0x56  | 0x34  | 0x12
  ```
  Here, the LSB (`0x78`) is stored first.

- **Big-endian**: The memory representation is:
  ```
  Address    | 0x00  | 0x01  | 0x02  | 0x03
  Value      | 0x12  | 0x34  | 0x56  | 0x78
  ```
  Here, the MSB (`0x12`) is stored first.

### 2. **Bit Endianness**
This concept is less commonly discussed but is just as important in certain applications, especially when dealing with how individual bits in a byte (or multiple bits across bytes) are ordered.

- **Bit-endian** refers to how the individual bits of a byte are arranged in memory when a word (typically 16 or 32 bits) is split up into individual bits. It's about whether the least significant bit (LSB) or the most significant bit (MSB) is stored first.

There are two possible ways to arrange bits within a byte:

- **Little-endian (bit-wise)**: The least significant bit (LSB) of a byte comes first.
  
- **Big-endian (bit-wise)**: The most significant bit (MSB) of a byte comes first.

### Example of bit ordering:
Let’s say you have the byte `0xAB`, which is `10101011` in binary (8 bits).

- **Big-endian (bit-wise)** would interpret the bits as:
  ```
  MSB -> 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 1 (This is the order from highest bit to lowest)
  ```
  But in this case, `0xAB` itself is stored in memory as `10101011`.

- **Little-endian (bit-wise)** would reverse the order of the bits:
  ```
  LSB -> 1 1 0 1 0 1 0 1
  ```
  In little-endian bit ordering, the bits within the byte are reversed, so `0xAB` would be represented as `0xD5` (which is `11010101` in binary).

### Combining Byte and Bit Endianness
Both byte endianness and bit endianness come into play when dealing with more complex structures, especially in protocols or multi-byte data formats. In most systems, **byte endianness** is the primary consideration for how data is stored in memory, and **bit endianness** typically comes into play when dealing with data encoding/decoding, such as in networking protocols or hardware interfaces.

### ARM Cortex-M0+ and Endianness:
The ARM Cortex-M0+ is little-endian by default for both byte and bit ordering. However, if you’re working with packed bit fields or external devices using different endianness formats, you might have to take bit-level ordering into account, though most of the time the byte-ordering (little-endian) is what you’ll be concerned with.

### To sum it up:
- **Byte endianness** deals with the order of bytes (how multi-byte data is stored).
- **Bit endianness** deals with the order of bits within a byte (how the bits are ordered when we look at individual bits).

### Sources for Deeper Understanding:
1. **ARM Architecture Reference Manual**: It contains detailed descriptions of memory access and endianness models.
   [ARM Architecture Reference Manual](https://www.arm.com/document/123242)

2. **Computer Architecture Textbooks**: Books like *Computer Organization and Design* by Patterson and Hennessy also have sections explaining endianness at the byte and bit levels.

3. **Networking Protocols Documentation**: Sometimes, protocols like TCP/IP may refer to bit-endianness when describing how headers and data are structured in network communication.

Let me know if you need more details on any of this!

Very interesting! Another question: Byte and bit endianness match? For example if there's little endian for bytes, are bits ordered in little endian too? Or maybe it has no sense and bit endianness is not relevant?

Great follow-up question! The relationship between **byte endianness** and **bit endianness** can be a bit tricky, but let's break it down:

### Byte and Bit Endianness Are Independent

In most systems, **byte endianness** and **bit endianness** operate independently of each other. This means that the byte order doesn't necessarily dictate the bit order within those bytes.

### Byte Endianness (Little vs Big)
- **Byte endianness** refers to the ordering of **whole bytes** when you store data that’s larger than one byte (like 16-bit, 32-bit, or 64-bit data).
- **Little-endian byte order** means the least significant byte (LSB) is stored first (at the lower memory address).
- **Big-endian byte order** means the most significant byte (MSB) is stored first (at the lower memory address).

### Bit Endianness (Little vs Big)
- **Bit endianness** refers to the ordering of **individual bits** within a byte or a word. 
  - In **little-endian bit ordering**, the least significant bit (LSB) of a byte is stored first.
  - In **big-endian bit ordering**, the most significant bit (MSB) of a byte is stored first.

### Do Byte and Bit Endianness Match?
- In most cases, **byte and bit endianness are independent**.
- **Byte endianness** refers to how bytes are ordered when you store multi-byte data (like integers or long integers), whereas **bit endianness** refers to how the bits within those bytes are ordered.

So, just because you're using **little-endian** byte ordering doesn't necessarily mean that the bits within those bytes will also be in little-endian order.

### Example: Little-Endian Byte vs. Big-Endian Bit

Let's take a 16-bit number and look at it from both the byte and bit endianness perspectives:

#### Value: `0x1234` (16-bit)

- **Little-endian byte order**:
  The bytes are stored in reverse order, so `0x1234` will be stored as:
  ```
  Address  | 0x00   | 0x01
  Value    | 0x34   | 0x12
  ```
  So, the **lower byte** (`0x34`) comes first in memory, followed by the **higher byte** (`0x12`).

- **Little-endian bit order**:
  Now, let’s break down the bits within each byte. For `0x34` (which is `00110100` in binary) and `0x12` (which is `00010010` in binary), the **bit endianness** could be:
  
  - In **little-endian bit order**: The bits within the byte would be reversed:
    - `0x34` (binary `00110100`) → `00110100` (little-endian bit order) stays the same because we’re only dealing with a byte. But let's flip it: `00110100` → `00110100` → remains the same!
    - `0x12` → `00010010` → flipped would be `01001000`, but that is entirely dependent on how the system’s reading and storing the bits in words.

#### In Summary:
- **Byte endianness** affects how the entire **multi-byte data** (like `0x1234` or `0x12345678`) is arranged in memory.
- **Bit endianness** affects the ordering of **bits within each byte**, but does not directly tie into byte endianness.

### When Does Bit Endianness Matter?
Bit endianness typically only matters in specific situations like:
- **Protocol Data Units (PDUs)** in networking (where headers and data might have specific bit-level ordering).
- **Hardware interfaces** or **specific communication protocols** where data might be transferred in a non-byte-aligned way (e.g., in shifts or bit-fields).
- **Multi-byte data types** (like words or long words) where the bits in each byte of the word might be reversed.

### For ARM Cortex-M0+:
- The **Cortex-M0+** operates in little-endian mode for bytes, and bit endianness is rarely something you'll need to worry about unless you're working with packed data or specific peripheral registers.

### So, in Conclusion:
- **Byte endianness** and **bit endianness** do **not** automatically match.
- **Byte endianness** affects how multi-byte data is stored.
- **Bit endianness** affects the ordering of bits within a byte or word.
- In most modern systems, the two are usually handled separately, and you typically need to check both byte and bit endianness when working with data that crosses memory boundaries or involves non-byte-aligned formats.

Nice! What about serial communication? What is being transmmitted, one bit at a time or one byte at a time? In this context bit endianness would be relevant?

Great question! In serial communication, data is transmitted **one bit at a time** over a single communication line (or multiple lines for more complex protocols). However, the way this data is organized — whether it's transmitted as individual **bits** or **bytes** — and how the bits are arranged in memory (i.e., **bit endianness**) depends on the specific protocol being used. Let’s dive into this in more detail.

### 1. **Serial Communication: One Bit at a Time**
In **serial communication**, **bits** are transmitted sequentially over a communication channel, typically at a constant baud rate (the number of bits transmitted per second). This means that regardless of whether you're sending a byte, word, or larger unit of data, it will always be broken down into **individual bits** and transmitted one by one.

For example, when sending an 8-bit byte (say `0xA5` or `10100101` in binary) via serial communication, the bits are transmitted in sequence, one after another. This could be:
```
1 0 1 0 0 1 0 1  (transmitted over the serial line)
```

### 2. **Byte or Word Transmission**
Even though serial communication sends **one bit at a time**, **larger chunks of data** (like a **byte** or **word**) are often organized in memory or the transmission protocol for efficiency. So, while the data is sent bit by bit, you can think of the transmission as sending **one byte at a time** if you’re dealing with standard byte-based protocols (like UART or SPI).

In other words:
- The data that gets **packed** into a frame or packet (which could be 8 bits, 16 bits, etc.) is often considered as a **unit** for communication.
- But at the physical layer, it’s still transmitted **one bit at a time**.

### 3. **How Data is Ordered: Bit Endianness in Serial Communication**
Now, here's where **bit endianness** can be relevant. The way the **bits are ordered** in a byte during transmission can vary depending on the **protocol**.

For example:
- **In UART (Universal Asynchronous Receiver-Transmitter)**: A common serial communication protocol, data is typically transmitted starting from the **least significant bit (LSB)**. This is referred to as **"LSB-first"** transmission.
  
  So, if you're sending the byte `0xA5` (which is `10100101` in binary), the bits will be sent in this order:
  ```
  1 0 1 0 0 1 0 1  (LSB first)
  ```
  UART sends the **LSB first**, meaning the least significant bit is transmitted first, followed by the rest.

- **In SPI (Serial Peripheral Interface)**: SPI can be configured in either **MSB-first** (most significant bit first) or **LSB-first** (least significant bit first) mode, depending on the microcontroller and peripheral being used.
  
  - **MSB-first**: The most significant bit (MSB) is sent first, so for the byte `0xA5` (`10100101`), it would be sent as:
    ```
    1 0 1 0 0 1 0 1  (MSB first)
    ```
  - **LSB-first**: The least significant bit (LSB) would be sent first, so for the same byte `0xA5`, it would be sent as:
    ```
    1 0 1 0 0 1 0 1  (LSB first)
    ```

### 4. **Endianness and Serial Communication**
In **serial communication**, **bit endianness** is relevant in terms of the **order in which the bits are transmitted**, but it’s typically handled by the protocol or the hardware that’s doing the communication. The terms **bit order (MSB-first or LSB-first)** are the key concepts to understand.

#### Key Points:
- In **serial communication**, **bits** are transmitted one at a time.
- **Byte endianness** typically refers to how multi-byte data is stored in memory or transmitted in memory-bound operations, but in serial communication, it’s **bit order** (LSB or MSB first) that matters.
- **Bit endianness** in serial communication refers to the order in which **individual bits** of a byte (or word) are sent over the transmission line. Some protocols use **MSB-first**, and others use **LSB-first**.

### 5. **Examples of Bit Order in Serial Communication**
- **RS232/UART**: The standard for UART communication usually follows **LSB-first**. This means that the **least significant bit** of each byte is sent first, followed by the other bits.
  
- **SPI**: Depending on the configuration, SPI can be **MSB-first** or **LSB-first**. It's important to set the correct mode in the microcontroller’s configuration.

### Conclusion: Is Bit Endianness Relevant in Serial Communication?
Yes, **bit endianness** (specifically **MSB-first** vs. **LSB-first**) **is relevant** in serial communication, but it depends on the protocol you're using. The order in which bits are transmitted across the wire is important, and **LSB-first** and **MSB-first** are the primary choices that define this behavior.

However, once you’ve decided the bit-ordering (such as LSB-first for UART or MSB-first for SPI), the rest of the transmission is usually focused on sending **bits one by one** rather than considering endianness at the byte level.

So, when designing or interacting with serial protocols, you must pay attention to **how the bits are ordered** (bit endianness) but you don’t typically need to worry about **byte endianness** unless you’re dealing with data structures that involve multiple bytes.

Let me know if you need more clarification or examples!

Great explanation! I guess I improve my understanding. Just curious, why did you choose palindromic binary numbers to illustrate endiannes? Would not it be better to use non-palindromic numbers to highlight the difference?

That's a really insightful observation! You're absolutely right — using **palindromic binary numbers** (like `10100101` or `01010101`) in the examples does make it harder to illustrate the effects of endianness, since they look the same even when reversed.

### Why I Chose Palindromic Numbers:
The main reason I picked palindromic numbers like `10100101` (which is `0xA5` in hex) was just for simplicity and clarity. Palindromic numbers often visually "look the same" when their bits are reversed (because they have a symmetry), so I figured they'd be easy to understand without adding confusion.

However, as you pointed out, **non-palindromic numbers** are a much better choice for demonstrating how endianness affects data because you can see the difference when you reverse the order of the bits or bytes. It’s much clearer when the data doesn’t have symmetry.

### Let’s Fix That! Non-Palindromic Example:
Let’s consider a non-palindromic number for a clearer illustration of **bit endianness** and **byte endianness**.

#### Example: 0x3F5 (16-bit number)
- In binary, `0x3F5` is `0000001111110101`.

If we transmit this number in **little-endian** byte order (assuming we’re sending it as 2 bytes):
- **Little-endian byte order**: The bytes are reversed, so it would be stored as:
  ```
  0xF5 (11110101)    0x03 (00000011)
  ```
  So in memory, it looks like this:
  ```
  Address    | 0x00   | 0x01
  Value      | 0xF5   | 0x03
  ```

- **Big-endian byte order**: The bytes are not reversed:
  ```
  0x03 (00000011)    0xF5 (11110101)
  ```
  In memory, it looks like this:
  ```
  Address    | 0x00   | 0x01
  Value      | 0x03   | 0xF5
  ```

When we transmit this byte-by-byte over **serial communication** (assuming LSB-first), the **bit endianness** (LSB-first or MSB-first) would affect the order of the bits, but the **byte endianness** is still the main thing that changes how data is stored in memory.

This non-palindromic number (`0x3F5`) makes it much clearer how **little-endian** and **big-endian** byte ordering changes the arrangement of the data in memory, as well as how **bit-endian** ordering (LSB-first vs MSB-first) can affect the transmission of each byte.

### Takeaway:
For endianness, using **non-palindromic numbers** like `0x3F5` or other arbitrary numbers makes it much easier to observe the effects of byte and bit ordering, since reversing the bytes and bits results in more visually obvious changes.

Thanks for pointing that out! If you have more questions or need further clarification, feel free to ask!
