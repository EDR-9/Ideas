To bind hexadecimal data into a binary file, such as a `.s19` file (Motorola S-record format), you'll generally be working with the output of a compiler or assembler for your embedded system. The `.s19` file is a standard format used for transferring binary data (such as machine code) to embedded systems. It encodes the binary code as hexadecimal values, with specific fields for address, data, and checksum information.

Here's a step-by-step overview of how you can do this:

### Step 1: Generate the Hexadecimal Data (Compiled Code)
After compiling or assembling your C code (or another source language) for your embedded system, you will have the compiled object code, often in a hexadecimal format. Typically, this is done by a toolchain that produces output files like `.bin`, `.hex`, or `.elf`. For example:

1. **Using GCC** to generate a `.bin` or `.elf` file:
    ```bash
    arm-none-eabi-gcc -o my_program.elf my_program.c
    ```

    This will create a `.elf` file, which is an executable in a common format used for embedded systems.

2. **Using `objcopy` to convert the ELF file to a raw binary format**:
    ```bash
    arm-none-eabi-objcopy -O binary my_program.elf my_program.bin
    ```

    This command will generate a `.bin` file that contains the raw machine code as binary data.

### Step 2: Convert Hexadecimal to Motorola S-record (`.s19`)
Once you have your binary or hexadecimal data, you can convert it into the Motorola S-record format. This format is a standard for representing binary data in text form, and itâ€™s used for flashing the data into embedded systems.

#### Using `objcopy` to create a `.s19` file
If you have a binary or ELF file and want to convert it to the S-record format (`.s19`), you can use the `objcopy` tool to do so.

1. **Convert to S-record format:**
    ```bash
    arm-none-eabi-objcopy -O srec my_program.elf my_program.s19
    ```

    This will convert the ELF binary to the Motorola S-record format.

2. Alternatively, if you already have a raw binary file (`.bin`), you can use a tool like `srec_cat`:

    ```bash
    srec_cat my_program.bin -binary -output my_program.s19 -srec
    ```

    This will convert the binary file (`my_program.bin`) into an S-record (`my_program.s19`).

### Step 3: Understand the Motorola S-record Format
The `.s19` file format is a text file that contains lines of records, each representing a block of binary data with an associated memory address.

- **S0 record**: Contains general information (file header).
- **S1, S2, S3 records**: Data records, where each record contains:
    - **Address** (the memory location for the data),
    - **Data** (the actual binary code),
    - **Checksum** (for error detection).

### Example of an S-record (`.s19` file):
```plaintext
S113000028C00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000F0
S9030000FC
```

This represents a block of data with a starting address and checksum information. The first part `S1` indicates the type of record, and the following hex values represent the address and data.

### Step 4: Flashing the S-record to the Embedded System
Once you have the `.s19` file, it can be used to flash the binary code to your embedded device, typically using a programmer/debugger (like J-Link, ST-Link, or OpenOCD) that supports the S-record format.

For example:
```bash
openocd -f interface/jlink.cfg -f target/stm32f4x.cfg -c "program my_program.s19 verify reset exit"
```

This will use OpenOCD to flash the `.s19` file onto the target embedded system.

### Summary of Tools:
- **GCC (arm-none-eabi-gcc)**: Compiles your C code for an embedded system.
- **objcopy**: Converts an ELF or binary file to an S-record (`.s19`) format.
- **srec_cat**: A tool to convert binary files to various S-record formats.
- **OpenOCD / J-Link / ST-Link**: Used for flashing the resulting `.s19` file to the embedded system.

### Conclusion:
To bind hexadecimal code (such as compiled C code) into a binary file like `.s19`, you generally:
1. Compile your source code into an ELF or binary format.
2. Use `objcopy` or a tool like `srec_cat` to convert the binary into the Motorola S-record format (`.s19`).
3. Flash the resulting `.s19` file onto your embedded system using a compatible programmer.
