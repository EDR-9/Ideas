Great! It sounds like you're looking to generate a **composite hex file** where multiple hex files (likely compiled code or data) are placed at specific locations in the memory space, which can be a common task when dealing with embedded systems or memory-mapped I/O.

To achieve this, you’ll need to:
1. **Identify where in memory** each of the individual hex files should go.
2. **Bind (concatenate) them** together at the correct memory offsets.
3. Optionally, **pad** the regions between files to ensure they align correctly in memory.

Here's a step-by-step guide on how to accomplish this:

### Steps to Bind Hex Files in Desired Positions:

1. **Prepare the Hex Files**:
   - First, make sure you have all the individual hex files generated by the compilation process. These hex files represent data or code sections that you want to place into specific locations in memory.

2. **Determine the Memory Layout**:
   - You’ll need to plan how the hex files will be arranged in the memory space. For example:
     - File 1 starts at memory address `0x0000`.
     - File 2 starts at memory address `0x1000`.
     - File 3 starts at memory address `0x2000`.
   - The "starting memory address" is essentially the **offset** where each file should be placed in the final composite hex file.

3. **Create a Tool or Script to Bind the Files**:
   - You can write a script (in Python, for example) to load the hex files, pad them to the desired memory locations, and then concatenate them together into a single file.

### Example Python Script to Bind Hex Files at Specific Positions:

Let's assume you have three hex files: `file1.hex`, `file2.hex`, and `file3.hex`, and you want them to appear at addresses `0x0000`, `0x1000`, and `0x2000` respectively in the output file.

```python
def load_hex_file(file_path):
    """Loads a hex file into a byte array."""
    with open(file_path, 'r') as file:
        hex_data = file.read().strip()
    # Convert hex string into bytes
    return bytes.fromhex(hex_data)

def write_combined_hex(output_file, memory_map):
    """Writes the combined hex data to an output file at specified memory locations."""
    # Create a byte array to hold the final combined data
    total_size = max([start + len(data) for start, data in memory_map])  # Total size of output file
    combined_data = bytearray(total_size)
    
    # Place each hex file at the specified memory address
    for start, data in memory_map:
        combined_data[start:start+len(data)] = data

    # Write the final combined data to output
    with open(output_file, 'wb') as file:
        file.write(combined_data)

# Example memory map: (starting address, file path)
memory_map = [
    (0x0000, 'file1.hex'),
    (0x1000, 'file2.hex'),
    (0x2000, 'file3.hex')
]

# Load hex files
memory_map = [(start, load_hex_file(file_path)) for start, file_path in memory_map]

# Combine the hex files at the specified memory locations and write to output
output_file = 'combined.hex'
write_combined_hex(output_file, memory_map)

print(f'Combined hex file saved to {output_file}')
```

### Explanation:
1. **Load Hex Files**: The function `load_hex_file()` reads the content of each hex file and converts it from a hex string to raw bytes.
2. **Memory Mapping**: The `memory_map` is a list of tuples where each tuple consists of:
   - A memory **start address** (e.g., `0x0000` for the first file).
   - The corresponding **hex file path**.
3. **Combine Hex Files**: The script calculates the total size of the final memory image and initializes a `bytearray` to hold the final combined data. Then, it places each hex file at the correct offset.
4. **Write to Output**: Finally, the script writes the resulting byte array to a new hex file (`combined.hex`), which now contains the hex files bound at the specified memory positions.

### **Padding and Alignment**:
If your memory layout requires padding between the files, you can add padding (e.g., zeroes) to the memory regions where there’s unused space. In the example above, the `combined_data` bytearray automatically handles padding because it’s sized to accommodate the largest memory address plus the length of the data.

For more control over padding, you could modify the script to explicitly add zero bytes or other filler data between the files, depending on your needs.

### **Considerations**:
- **Endianness**: Ensure that the endianness of the data matches the target architecture (e.g., little-endian vs big-endian).
- **Memory Constraints**: Ensure that the total size of the combined hex file fits within the available memory space.
- **Hex Format**: The above script assumes the hex files are in a plain hex format, but if you're dealing with Intel HEX format or Motorola S-records, you may need additional parsing.
